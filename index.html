            <h2>OUR GUIDING PRINCIPLES</h2>

            <div>
                <h3>OPEN SOURCES</h3>
                <p>We’re open about where our tea comes from. Every kilo of tea we buy is traceable to the trees it was
                    plucked from. We publish farm coordinates, media from origin, and interviews with our producers.
                    They’re
                    dear friends who update us regularly on tea production and farm life when we can’t be there
                    ourselves.

                    (Keep up with them here.)

                    Our transparency model is progressive in an industry where the norm is to conceal (partially or
                    wholly)
                    information about tea sources. When we reference open sources—we don’t mean our site code!—we’re
                    talking
                    about real places you can see and learn about…even visit. We have nothing to hide</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>DIRECT LANGAUGE</h3>
                <p>

                    Tea is complex. Distilling its long history, rich culture, and the current science into useful,
                    easily
                    understood information is our job as modern tea importers. It’s easy to use exotic-sounding verbiage
                    and
                    folklore in lieu of providing objective information. And whether it’s intentional or not, that style
                    of
                    mystique marketing does a disservice to specialty tea. We reject it.

                    Clear, concise information is the bedrock of transparency. From origin transparency, to processing
                    descriptions, to flavor notes, we speak in acessible, objective terms about tea. But you don’t need
                    to
                    be any type of “nerd” to appreciate our tea at a high level. Ask us anything. We won’t talk past
                    you.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>COFFEE EDUCATION</h3>
                <p>Helping you learn about tea is our first priority. We favor hard science, and make special efforts to
                    bring verified, unfiltered information directly from our producers to you. Untruths in tea are
                    persistent, and often leveraged to—surprise!—sell more tea. We reject this, too. Our objective is to
                    communicate tea’s realities, and help you be a better buyer of this very special product.

                    To do this, we limit our subjective interpretations when sharing information about tea, opting
                    instead
                    to let the facts guide you. We make every intimate detail available, and encourage your questions.
                    Please, pry! Educating tea drinkers is a pure expense for us, but the return is significant: an
                    accessible modern tea culture driven by informed people like you</p>
